<p>
    Please read the instructions carefully before you start the game!
    <br><br>
    The game is played by <b>4 players</b> in total: you and 3 computerized players.
    The computerized players' choices are based on average players, as well your choices.
    Together with the other players, you share a shared common forest.
    At the start of the game, the forest contains <b>20 trees</b>. The game is played for <b>10 rounds</b>.
    In each round, all of the players choose how many trees to remove from the common forest.
    The trees you remove will convert into your profit at the end of the game. Every removed tree equals 0.5 profit.
    You have the option to remove either <b>0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 trees</b>.
    The regrowth rate of the forest is <b>8 trees per round</b>.
    This means that in each round, 8 new trees are added to the forest.
    <br><br>
    During the game you have the opportunity to earn an eco-label! Your production must be sustainable to earn the eco-label.
    If you remove 0, 1 or 2 tree(s) in every round, your production is considered sustainable.
    Once you remove more than 2 trees in any round,
    your production is not sustainable anymore, for the rest of the game.
    If you earn the eco-label, your profit per tree will remain the same.
    <br><br>
    <b>BE WARE!</b> When the forest reaches 0 trees, you and the other players have exploited the forest.
    If this happens, the forest dies and the game ends. If the game ends before completing 10 rounds,
    all players will loose their profits.
    <br><br>
    All the trees that remain in the forest at the end of the game, will be planted in real life.
    If you would like to receive a certificate of the trees that we planted, please fill in your e-mail address below:
    {{ formfield 'tree_certificate' }}
    Of all participants, one will be randomly chosen of which the profit will be paid out.
    If you would like to have a chance to receive your profit, please fill in your e-mail address below:
    {{ formfield 'profit_certificate' }}

<h3>Example!</h3>
<p>
    Let's say you have removed the following number of trees:
    <br>
<table style="width:40%">
    <tr>
        <th>Round</th>
        <th>Tree removal</th>
        <th>Profit</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Round 1</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>1.0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Round 2</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>1.5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Round 3</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>2.0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Round 4</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0.5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Round 5</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>2.0</td>
    </tr>
</table>
    <br>
    After round 5 the forest has 0 trees left and the game ends. <br><br>
    This means that you have <b>removed 14 trees</b> from the forest in total. <br>
    This will give you a <b>profit of 7</b>. <br>
    Your production process is not considered sustainable. <br><br>
