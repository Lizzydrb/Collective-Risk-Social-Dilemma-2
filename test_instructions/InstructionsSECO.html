<p>
    Please read the instructions carefully before you start the game!
    <br><br>
    The game is played by <b>4 players</b> in total: you and 3 computerized players.
    The computerized players' choices are based on average players, the sequence of the game and some randomness.
    Together with the other players, you share a shared common forest.
    At the start of the game, the forest contains <b>20 trees</b>. The game is played for <b>10 rounds</b>.
    In each round, all of the players choose how many trees to cut down from the common forest.
    The trees you cut down equal points earned and will convert into your profit at the end of the game.
    <b>Every cut down tree equals 1 point</b>, which at the end of the game will be converted into <b>0.5 EUR profit</b> (1 point = 0.5 EUR).
    You have the option to cut down either <b>0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 trees</b>.
    The regrowth rate of the forest is <b>8 trees per round</b>.
    This means that in each round, 8 new trees are added to the forest.
    <br><br>
    During the game you have the opportunity to earn an eco-label! Your production must be sustainable to earn the eco-label.
    If you remove 0, 1 or 2 tree(s) in every round, your production is considered sustainable.
    Once you remove more than 2 trees in any round,
    your production is not sustainable anymore, for the rest of the game (even if your average tree removal over rounds is 2 or less).
    If you earn the eco-label, your points per tree will remain the same.
    <br><br>
    <b>BE WARE!</b> The game ends after 10 rounds, or when the forest has 0 trees left.
    If the forest has 0 trees left, it means that you and the other players have exploited the forest due to your behavior.
    If this happens, the forest dies and the game ends. This means that there are no rounds left to remove trees and earn points.
    <br><br>
    All the trees that remain in the forest at the end of the game, will be planted in real life.
    <br>
    Of all participants, one will be randomly chosen of which the profit will be paid out.
</p>

<h3>Example!</h3>
<p>
    Let's say you have removed the following number of trees:
    <br>
<table style="width:40%">
    <tr>
        <th>Round</th>
        <th>Tree removal</th>
        <th>Points</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Round 1</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Round 2</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Round 3</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Round 4</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Round 5</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>4</td>
    </tr>
</table>
    <br>
    Due to you and your group's behaviour, after round 5 the forest has 0 trees left and the game ends.<br><br>
    This means that you have <b>removed 14 trees</b> from the forest in total. <br>
    This will give you a <b>profit of 14 * 0.5 = 7 EUR</b>. <br>
    Your production process is not considered sustainable because you withdrew more than 2 trees in round 2. <br><br>
