<p>
    Please read the instructions carefully before you start the game!
    <br><br>
    The game is played by <b>4 players</b> in total: you and 3 computerized players.
    The computerized players' choices are based on average players, as well your choices.
    Together with the other players, you share a shared common forest.
    At the start of the game, the forest contains <b>20 trees</b>. The game is played for <b>10 rounds</b>.
    In each round, all of the players choose how many trees to remove from the common forest.
    The trees you remove will convert into your profit at the end of the game. Every removed tree equals 0.5 profit.
    You have the option to remove either <b>0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 trees</b>.
    The regrowth rate of the forest is <b>8 trees per round</b>.
    This means that in each round, 8 new trees are added to the forest.
    <br><br>
    If you remove 0, 1 or 2 tree(s) in every round, your production is considered sustainable.
    Once you remove more than 2 trees in any round,
    your production is not sustainable anymore, for the rest of the game.
    <br><br>
    <b>BE WARE!</b> When the forest reaches 0 trees, you and the other players have exploited the forest.
    If this happens, the forest dies and the game ends. This means that there are no rounds left to remove trees and earn a profit.
    <br><br>
</p>

<h3>Example!</h3>
<p>
    Let's say you have removed the following number of trees:
    <br>
<table style="width:40%">
    <tr>
        <th>Round</th>
        <th>Tree removal</th>
        <th>Profit</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Round 1</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>1.0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Round 2</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>1.5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Round 3</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>2.0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Round 4</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0.5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Round 5</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>2.0</td>
    </tr>
</table>
    <br>
    After round 5 the forest has 0 trees left and the game ends. <br><br>
    This means that you have <b>removed 14 trees</b> from the forest in total. <br>
    This will give you a <b>profit of 7</b>. <br>
    Your production process is not considered sustainable. <br><br>
