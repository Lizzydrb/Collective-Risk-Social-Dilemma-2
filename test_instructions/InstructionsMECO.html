        You are about to play a Collective Risk Social Dilemma. Please read the instructions carefully before you start the game!
        <br><br>
        The game is played by <b>4 players</b>. Together with the other players, you share a shared common forest.
        At the start of the game, the forest contains <b>20 trees</b>. The game is played for 10 rounds.
        In each round, all of the players choose how many trees to withdraw from the common forest.
        The trees you withdraw will convert into your profit at the end of the game. Every withdrawn tree equals 0.5 profit.
        You have the option to withdraw either <b>0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 trees</b>.
        The regrowth rate of the forest is <b>8 trees per round</b>. This means that in each round, 8 new trees are added to the forest.
        <br><br>
        During the game you have the opportunity to earn an eco-label!
        If you withdraw 0, 1 or 2 tree(s) in every round, your production is considered sustainable.
        Once you withdraw more than 2 trees in any round,
        your production is not sustainable anymore, for the rest of the game.
        If you earn the eco-label, your profit per tree will be increased to 0.625!
        <br><br>
        BE WARE! When the forest reaches 0 trees, you and the other players have exploited the forest.
        If this happens, the forest dies and the game ends. If the game ends before completing 10 rounds,
        all players will loose their profits.
